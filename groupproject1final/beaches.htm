<p id="title"><b><u>Beaches</u></b></p>
<!--Beach 1-->

<h2>Hanauma Bay</h2>
<p>Hanauma Bay is both a Nature Preserve and a Marine Life Conservation District. The Bay features an abundance of sea turtles, which are called “honu.” In order to protect the honu and the other wildlife, visitors to the area are required to watch a video before entering the park. Hanauma Bay snorkeling is so popular because of the wide variety of species in the bay. In addition to the turtles, snorkelers can take a peek at the Humuhumunukunukuapuaa (the state fish of Hawaii).</p></br>

<!--Beach 2-->

<h2>Waikiki Beach</h2>
<p>Waikiki is most famous for its beaches and every room is just two or three blocks away from the sea. With Leahi (Diamond Head) as your backdrop, the calm waters of Waikiki are perfect for a surfing lesson. In fact, legendary Hawaiian waterman Duke Kahanamoku grew up surfing the waves of Waikiki. This Olympic gold medalist in swimming actually taught visitors how to surf at the turn of the century and was later known as "The father of modern surfing." Today, the Waikiki Beach Boys perpetuate Duke's legacy by teaching visitors how to surf and canoe and the Duke Kahanamoku Statue has become an iconic symbol of Waikiki.</p></br>

<!--Beach 3-->

<h2>Ala Moana Beach Park</h2>
<p>Ala Moana Beach Park is a free public park on Oahu, located between Waikiki and downtown Honolulu. The water is almost always calm because the beach is protected by an outer reef. This makes it a good spot for long-distance swimmers and small children. Big grassy areas, banyans and palm trees make the park a good place to picnic, barbecue, play all kinds of ball games or go running. Ala Moana Beach Park is a favorite among Honolulu residents. On the weekends, they come here with their whole ohana (family) to picnic, swim and spend time together. It is right next to "Magic Island" where many cultural events are held.</p></br>

<!--Beach 4-->

<h2 id="northshoretitle">North Shore</h2>
<p id="northshore">The North Shore is considered to be the surfing mecca of the world, and every December hosts three competitions, which make up the Triple Crown of Surfing. It is also known for the massive waves that come crashing in during the end of the year. Every year, North Shore waves make headlines all over the world.</p></br>

<!--Beach 5-->

<h2>Bellows Beach Park</h2>
<p>One of the more popular ocean recreation areas on Oahu is located on the windward coast. This beautiful beach has shallow water and a small consistent shore break making it perfect for swimmers and beginer sufers.</p></br>
